 - CSS;

 - Bootstrap.

I used the DOM to manipulate the notes and make my logical for their appear or not.

I made the objects design on Canva.

# Introduction
I started my web page creating a HTML page using the default HTML:5 code.
On index.html bootstrap was fundamental to make the styles and the basics scripts.

I started making the navbar and integrating its to my necessities, using the image that I created on canva
to be my favicon.

CSS was my second challenge in this project, I need to learn new things about it to make my project batter than was.

JavaScript script was the harder thing that I've made, I need to learn DOM and I take the sticky notes maded on my html and css and integrated it on my script.js. This is my script.js:

            let random_margin = ["-5px", "1px", "5px", "10px", "7px"];
            let random_colors = ["#c2ff3d","#ff3de8","#3dc2ff","#04e022","#bc83e6","#ebb328"];
            let random_degree = ["rotate(3deg)", "rotate(1deg)", "rotate(-1deg)", "rotate(-3deg)", "rotate(-5deg)", "rotate(-8deg)"];
            let index = 0;

            window.onload = document.querySelector("#user_input").select();

            document.querySelector("#add_note").addEventListener("click", () => {
            document.querySelector("#modal").style.display = "block";
            });

            document.querySelector("#hide").addEventListener("click", () => {
            document.querySelector("#modal").style.display = "none";
            });

            document.querySelector("#user_input").addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
            if(event.key === 'Enter'){
                const text = document.querySelector("#user_input");
                createStickyNote(text.value);
            }
            });

            createStickyNote = (text) => {
            let note = document.createElement("div");
            let details = document.createElement("div");
            let noteText = document.createElement("h1");

            note.className = "note";
            details.className = "details";
            noteText.textContent = text;

            details.appendChild(noteText);
            note.appendChild(details);

            if(index > random_colors.length - 1)
                index = 0;

            note.setAttribute("style", `margin:${random_margin[Math.floor(Math.random() * random_margin.length)]}; background-color:${random_colors[index++]}; transform:${random_degree[Math.floor(Math.random() * random_degree.length)]}`);

            note.addEventListener("dblclick", () => {
                note.remove();
            })

            document.querySelector("#all_notes").appendChild(note);
            }
